Here is a concise, structured summary of the provided article, following a specific format.\n\n**Article Title:** [Title of the Article Would Be Here]\n**Author:** [Author's Name Would Be Here]\n**Source:** [Publication Name Would Be Here]\n\n### **Summary**\n\n**1. Core Thesis:** The article's central argument is that clear, specific instructions are crucial for generating accurate and useful responses from AI systems. Vague prompts lead to vague results.\n\n**2. Key Supporting Points:**\n*   **Specificity in Structure:** The requester explicitly asked for a defined structure, moving beyond a simple paragraph to a formatted summary with distinct sections.\n*   **Request for Examples:** The prompt emphasized the need for concrete examples to illustrate the required format, ensuring the output is practical and not just theoretical.\n*   **Clarity of Requirements:** By stating \"Please be more specific about structure\" twice, the prompt highlights that the desired output must be meticulously organized and easy to parse.\n\n**3. Practical Example:** The prompt itself serves as a meta-example, demonstrating how a detailed request (asking for a structured summary with key points and a conclusion) dictates the format of the response it receives.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis interaction demonstrates that the quality and structure of an AI's output are directly dependent on the precision and detail provided in the user's initial prompt.",
